🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Power BI and Excel Project on Blinkit Data! 📊

Blinkit (formerly known as Grofers) has revolutionized the on-demand grocery delivery space, and I took the opportunity to dive deep into their data to uncover actionable insights. This project involves analyzing Blinkit’s sales data, which provided a comprehensive view of various business metrics and trends.
🔍 Project Focus: In this analysis, I concentrated on several key areas:
Total Sales: Examined sales performance across different outlet types to identify which outlets are performing the best and also year wise which was best as per revenue generated.
Regional Performance: Analyzed sales data by region to understand geographical trends and variations.
Market Type: Investigated the different types of markets (supermarket and grocery) and their sales contributions.
Item Analysis: Evaluated the types of items sold, with a particular focus on fat content to understand customer preferences and health trends.
Customer Ratings: Correlated average customer ratings with sales data to identify the impact of ratings on sales performance.
📈 Dashboard Created:
 This dashboard visualizes total sales segmented by outlet type, items sold and in all tier 1, tier 2 and tier 3 states helping to pinpoint which types of outlets are generating the highest revenue.
Average Sales & Ratings: Showcases average sales figures and customer ratings, offering insights into how customer satisfaction correlates with sales performance.
Item Distribution Analysis: Displays the total number of items sold across various categories, with a detailed view of fat content in these items.
🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used:
Data Cleaning: Applied techniques to clean the raw data, addressing missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.
Power BI Visualization: Leveraged Power BI to create dynamic, interactive dashboards. Used Dax query to create measures for finding total sales, average of sales and rating and total items sold. This tool enabled me to present complex data in an intuitive and user-friendly format, providing valuable insights at a glance.
This project highlights the power of data analytics in making informed business decisions. The dashboard I developed not only provide a clear picture of Blinkit’s grocery sales performance but also offer actionable insights to drive strategic decisions.
